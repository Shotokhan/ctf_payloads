# ctf_payloads
Hosting for some useful payloads for CTFs.

The main purpose of this repository is eliminating the need of using ngrok tunnels for file servers, keeping the only free tunnel available for reverse shell connections.

Therefore, some publicly accessible files are hosted here, like a bash-revshell to upload on containers in which there isn't netcat and a JWT RS256 keypair to use for JKU claim misuse.
